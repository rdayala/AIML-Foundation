    "## Artificial Intelligence\n",
    "\n",
    "https://www.tutorialspoint.com/artificial_intelligence/index.htm\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the father of Artificial Intelligence, John McCarthy, it is “The science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs”.<br><br>\n",
    "“Can a machine think and behave like humans do?”\n",
    "AI is accomplished by studying how human brain thinks, and how humans learn, decide, and work while trying to solve a problem, and then using the outcomes of this study as a basis of developing intelligent software and systems.\n",
    "* Artificial intelligence is the branch of computer science concerned with making computers behave like humans.<br>\n",
    "* __AI__ is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems, so that they can be able to perform tasks normally require human intelligence.<br>\n",
    "        Ex : Visual perception, Speech recognition, decision-making, translation between languages, etc.\n",
    "* The overall research goal of artificial intelligence is to create technology that allows computers and machines to function in an intelligent manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "AI is the broader field where in intelligent systems(that have simulation of human intelligence) can do whole lot of things in a similar manner, a human being does.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Machine Learning - Programs that Alter Themselves\n",
    "\n",
    "* Machine learning is a subset of AI and focuses on the ability of machines to receive a set of data and learn for themselves, changing algorithms as they learn more about the information they are processing. \n",
    "* Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. \n",
    "* Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it learn for themselves.\n",
    "* Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows software applications to become more accurate in predicting outcomes without being explicitly programmed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.\" --Tom Mitchell<br><br>\n",
    "In 1959, Arthur Samuel, one of the pioneers of machine learning, defined machine learning as a “field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.” That is, machine-learning programs have not been explicitly entered into a computer, like the if-then statements above. Machine-learning programs, in a sense, adjust themselves in response to the data they’re exposed to.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Machine learning is so pervasive today that you probably use it dozens of times a day without knowing it. we are using Amazon, Google, Uber, Netflix, Waze, Facebook apps or websites in our daily busy life, they are all internally supported by machine learning algorithms.__\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* All machine learning is AI, but not all AI is machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deep Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "* It is based on neural networks, a conceptual model of the brain that has been around since the 1950s but largely ignored until recently. That’s because they are very computationally expensive and it’s only recently that 1) processing has become sufficiently cheap and powerful, through GPUs and FPGAs and 2) there’s been enough data to feel the DL algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep learning is a subset of machine learning. Usually, when people use the term deep learning, they are referring to deep artificial neural networks, and somewhat less frequently to deep reinforcement learning. <br><br>\n",
    "Deep artificial neural networks are a set of algorithms that have set new records in accuracy for many important problems, such as image recognition, sound recognition, recommender systems, etc.\n",
    "* The concept of deep learning is sometimes just referred to as \"deep neural networks,\" referring to the many layers involved. A neural network may only have a single layer of data, while a deep neural network has two or more. The layers can be seen as a nested hierarchy of related concepts or decision trees. The answer to one question leads to a set of deeper related questions.\n",
    "* Deep learning networks need to see __large quantities of items__ in order to be trained. \n",
    "\n",
    "__In machine learning case, we would have to define the features and let the system learn which features are the most important to classify. Whereas Deep learning takes a step ahead and automatically finds out the features which are important for classification__\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Is at the Heart of the Matter\n",
    "\n",
    "If the data being used is flawed, then the insights and information extracted will be flawed. So, Decisions need to be based off clean and meaningful data. \n",
    "\n",
    "__What is Data Cleansing?? __<br>\n",
    "The process of detecting and correcting (or removing) corrupt or inaccurate records from a record set, table or database and refers to identifying incomplete or irrelevant parts of the data and then replacing, modifying or deleting the dirty or coarse data.\n",
    "* Data scientists spend the majority of their time cleansing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For AI and machine learning to continue to advance, the data driving the algorithms and decisions need to be high-quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Science & Big Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of collecting and storing __large amounts__ of __structured and unstructured data__ for eventual analysis.<br><br>\n",
    "* Data can come from various sources and there are different dimensions to Big Data :\n",
    "        1. Volume\n",
    "        2. Velocity\n",
    "        3. Variety\n",
    "* When you have this huge amounts of Data, the challenges include :\n",
    "        data capture, \n",
    "        data curation, \n",
    "        storage, \n",
    "        analysis, \n",
    "        search, \n",
    "        querying, \n",
    "        updating, \n",
    "        information privacy, and \n",
    "        extract meaningful value.\n",
    "* Big data need to be analyzed for meaningful insights that lead to better decisions and strategic business values.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Finally :\n",
    "__ To extract meaningful value from big data, clients need Data Science skills, optimal processing/simulation models, big data analytic methods and machine/deep learning algorithms.__\n"
